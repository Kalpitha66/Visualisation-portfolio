## Problem Statement

To identify and analyze the market share distribution of counties in Florida using Power BI, aiming to understand regional economic dynamics and potential areas for targeted business expansion strategies


### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Load data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is an excel file.
- Step 2 : Data transformation

Calculate Market Share Percentage: Create a new column to calculate the market share percentage for each county using the formula: 
Market Share %
=
(
County Sales
Total Sales
)
×
100
Market Share %=( 
Total Sales
County Sales
​
 )×100

Standardize Data Formats: Ensure that numerical data is correctly formatted (e.g., percentages) and that text data, such as county names, follows a consistent format (e.g., title case).

Step 3: Data modelling 
Three key performance indicators were introduced for total humana members, total market share and total medicaid members 

Step 4: Data visualisation
Map Visualization:
Utilized a map visual to display Florida counties and applied conditional formatting to color-code counties based on their market share percentages. For instance:
0-15%: Red
15-25%: Gold
25-100%: Green

Step 5: Interactivity and formatting
Slicers and Filters: Add slicers to allow users to filter data by various dimensions, such as time periods or product categories.
Tooltips: Enhance visuals with tooltips that provide additional context when users hover over data points.
Formatting: Apply consistent color schemes, fonts, and shadows to improve the dashboard's aesthetic appeal and readability.
